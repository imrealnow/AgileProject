# AgileProject
This is a group project we made at school to make a functional online coffee shop prototype. For this, the end product wasn't as important as the process. 

While the main focus was on whether we were able to use agile methodologies correctly, we did manage to make a good website mockup using JavaScript to have pseudofunctionality.
