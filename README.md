# AgileProject
This is a group project we made at school to make a functional online coffee shop prototype. For this, the main focus was on the agile development rather than the end product. 

While the main focus was on whether we were able to use agile methodologies correctly, we did manage to make a good website mockup using JavaScript to have pseudofunctionality.

My role in it's development was modelling the data structures and developing a mock CRUD system for interacting with the data.
